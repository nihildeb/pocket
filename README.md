pocket
======

A CMS in a single HTML file which works offline with sync capabilities (tiddlywiki for the 2010s)

Using:
* AngularJS
* PouchDB

All data stored locally in Chome's idb (LevelDB) via Pouch. Will
support Firefox as soon as that is possible in Pouch. Will support IE
~~whenever Microsoft releases a functional browser~~ never

Just getting started, nothing to see here...
